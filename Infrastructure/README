#Amazon EKS Cluster with Terraform
- This repository contains a Terraform configuration to provision an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster on AWS. The setup includes a VPC with public and private subnets, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, IAM roles, security groups, an EKS node group with Spot Instances, and the AWS Load Balancer Controller installed via Helm.

#Overview
- The Terraform configuration creates the following resources:

- VPC: A Virtual Private Cloud with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16.
- Subnets: Two public and two private subnets across different Availability Zones (AZs) in us-east-1.
- Networking: Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, and route tables for public and private subnets.
- EKS Cluster: An EKS cluster (version 1.27) with public and private endpoint access.
- Node Group: A managed node group using Spot Instances (t3.medium) with a desired size of 2 nodes.
- IAM Roles: Roles for the EKS cluster, node group, and AWS Load Balancer Controller with appropriate policies.
- Security Groups: Rules for the EKS cluster and worker nodes, allowing necessary traffic (e.g., HTTPS, NodePort range).
- AWS Load Balancer Controller: Installed via Helm to manage Application Load Balancers (ALBs) for Kubernetes services.
- Outputs: Cluster endpoint, security group IDs, aws-auth ConfigMap, and kubeconfig for cluster access.
